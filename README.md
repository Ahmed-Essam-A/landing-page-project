## Requirements:

1. Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list. Start with empty ul and dynamically build navigation using Append, appendChild, and innerHTML.
2. It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.
3. When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.

## Additional Features:

1. Adding an active state to your navigation items when a section is in the viewport.
2. Adding a scroll to top button on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.
3. Making sections collapsible.

## Used Tech.:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. ES6

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.


## Dependencies
